		 <span i18n:translate="">When two Members have participated in the same Working Group, and when one or the other leaves this Working Group, whatever the reason, they have enough experience of work in common to mutually appreciate their respective cooperative behaviours. This opinion on the quality of the cooperative behaviour is expressed along a marking system with three steps:</span>
	     <ul>
			<li i18n:translate="">-1 = cooperative behaviour below what I expect in a Working Group</li>
			<li i18n:translate="">0 = cooperative behaviour in line with what I expect in a Working Group</li>
			<li i18n:translate="">+1 = cooperative behaviour better than what I expect in a Working Group</li>
	     </ul>
	    </p>
		<p i18n:translate="">
		  Once attributed, this mark is added to the one already established because of the marks given earlier by other Members.
		</p>
		<p i18n:translate="">
		  The system includes a "right to be forgotten". The weight of a mark given at a given date fades over time. It is divided by two at every "mid-life period": divided by 2 after one mid-life, by 4 after two mid-lives, by 8 after three, etc.This "mid-life period" belongs to the numeric parameters of the platform, and is equal to ${time_constant} days.
		</p>
		<p i18n:translate="">
		  The total mark, resulting from the accumulation of marks attributed over time, and fading away because of this "forgetfulness", indicates the trust that one can have in the future, when considering cooperating with this Member, e.g. when considering admitting him/her in a Working Group.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <b i18n:translate="">Expressed in a mathematical form, the formula giving the global mark M at date t, based on marks Mk attributed at the dates Tk, is: M = Sigma (k=1 to n) Mk.2^[-(t-Tk)/Tau] = Sigma (k=1 to n) Mk.exp[-ln(2).(t-Tk)/Tau], with Tau the "half-life period".</b>
