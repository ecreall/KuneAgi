	 Identity information. This information is meant to verify that a given natural person registers once, and once only, and that therefore the platform maintains the principle "1 person = 1 vote". This Identity Information will be kept strictly confidential, and will be disclosed only to three existing members of the platform, randomly selected upon your registration. Their duty will be to verify the correspondence between the Identity Information that you are about to write below, and those of your official ID documents.
