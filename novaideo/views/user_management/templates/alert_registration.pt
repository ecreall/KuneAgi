	 Identity information = given name(s), family name(s), date and place of birth. This information is meant to verify that a given natural person registers once, and once only, and that therefore the platform maintains the principle "1 person = 1 vote". This Identity Information will be kept strictly confidential, and will be disclosed only to three existing members of the platform, randomly selected upon your registration (the Verifiers). Their duty will be (1) to verify the correspondence between the Identity Information that you are about to write below, and those of one of your official ID documents, of which you will send them a copy directly by e-mail, without using the present on-line platform, (2) once this verification is performed, to destroy all copies of this official identity document from their computer, and to report to you accordingly. In compliance with our Terms of Use, your Identity Information will never be made visible to the other members on the platform. It will never be transmitted nor sold to anyone, except following a legal requirement.
