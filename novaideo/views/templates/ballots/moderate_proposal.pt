      Thereby, you contribute to ensuring that the content displayed on the platform ${novaideo_title} remains compliant with the Moderation Charter, while avoiding that the important power of Moderation be concentrated in just a few hands!

       If a majority of Moderators considers that this new Proposal does not comply with the Moderation Charter, it will remain hidden, otherwise, it will be published.
