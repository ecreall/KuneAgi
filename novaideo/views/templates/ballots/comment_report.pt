      You are invited, with two other randomly chosen Verifiers, to verify the adequacy between this <a i18n:name="dynamic" target="_blank" href="${context.get_url(request)}" class="alert-link"><span class="${getattr(context, 'icon', '')}"></span> <span i18n:translate="">comment</span></a>, that was reported as potentially non-compliant, and the Charter of Moderation.

      ${structure:getattr(request.virtual_root.moderation_rules, 'text', '')}
    </div>
    <p i18n:translate="">
      Thereby, you contribute to ensuring that the content displayed on the platform ${novaideo_title} remains compliant with the Moderation Charter, while avoiding that the important power of Moderation be concentrated in just a few hands!

    	If a majority of Moderators considers that this new Idea does not comply with the Moderation Charter, it will be withdrawn from the site, otherwise, it will be published.
